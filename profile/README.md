## Mission
Metronis Health-RL aims to build the worldâ€™s most comprehensive, open-source, **RL-native evaluation and safety framework for healthcare voice/text agents** â€” establishing a new global standard for trust and efficacy.  

This repository contains the **full-stack implementation** of a framework designed to **evaluate, monitor, and safeguard RL agents** in the high-stakes domain of healthcare.  



##  Why Metronis Health-RL?
While AI is poised to transform healthcare, **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** introduces risks unlike those seen in traditional ML. Current evaluation and MLOps tools cannot handle the **non-stationary, dynamic policies** of RL.  

Metronis Health-RL fills this critical gap with a **transparent, community-driven standard** trusted by clinicians, regulators, and patients.  



##  Features
-  **RL-Native Evaluation Suite** â€“ Detect Policy Drift, Reward Hacking, Constraint Violations, and Catastrophic Forgetting.  
-  **Safety Guardrails** â€“ Integrate safe RL (e.g., CPO) and real-time monitoring to block unsafe actions *before* they happen.  
-  **High-Fidelity Clinical Simulation** â€“ Gym-style environments (Sepsis Management, Medication Reconciliation).  
-  **Multi-Modal Security** â€“ Built-in defenses against deepfakes and adversarial audio attacks.  
-  **Causal & Explainable AI (XAI)** â€“ Counterfactual reasoning with plain-English explanations.  
- **Regulatory Automation** â€“ Draft-ready docs for FDA SaMD 510(k), HIPAA, and compliance workflows.  
- **Federated by Design** â€“ Privacy-preserving, multi-institution evaluation without data sharing.  
-  **Edge & Hybrid Deployment** â€“ Runs on-device, in cloud, or in air-gapped healthcare setups.

##  Architecture
Monorepo structure for full-stack integration:
/agents       â†’ RL algorithms, perception, reasoning, memory
/evals        â†’ Benchmarks, simulators, metrics, causal analysis
/safety       â†’ Guardrails, adversarial testing, monitoring
/data         â†’ Synthetic data, ETL pipelines, ontologies
/simulation   â†’ Gym-style healthcare environments
/dashboard    â†’ React frontend for visualization
/infra        â†’ Terraform IaC for HIPAA-compliant multi-cloud
/research     â†’ Reproducible research papers & experiments
